# Word Counter
Simple react app to count words

After downloading cd into word-counter-app

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:
```
  yarn start
    Starts the development server.

  yarn build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  yarn test
    Starts the test runner.

  yarn eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
```
To run the app type:

```
cd word-counter-app
yarn install
yarn start
```
This will start a react app that you can then see running in the location that it says in the terminal. 
You will need to have NPM installed.
